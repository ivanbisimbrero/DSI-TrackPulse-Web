## Style Guidelines:

- Use a clean, professional blue (#2E9AFE) for the primary interface elements to convey trust and efficiency.
- Implement a light gray (#F5F5F5) for backgrounds to ensure content legibility and reduce visual noise.
- Use green (#4CAF50) for success states like 'delivered' and red (#F44336) for error/issue states.
- Implement a card-based layout for shipments, using clear sections for products, status, and actions.
- Use consistent and recognizable icons from a standard library (e.g., Material Design Icons) for shipment statuses, actions, and categories.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and loading animations to provide feedback during data fetching and updates.
